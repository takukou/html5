    <h2>A Little Closer to the Edge<h6>BY OCEAN VUONG</h6></h2>
    
    
    <p>
        Young enough to believe nothing <br>
        will change them, they step, hand-in hand,
    </p>
    
    <p>
        into the bomb crater. The night full<br>
        of black teeth. His faux Rolex, weeks
    </p>
    
    <p>
        from shattering against her cheek, now    dims<br>
        like a miniature moon behind her hair.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In this version the snake is headless —   stilled<br>
        like a cord unraveled from the lovers’ ankles.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        He lifts her white cotton skirt, revealing<br>
        another hour. His hand. His hands. The syllables
    </p>
    
    <p>
        inside them. O father, O foreshadow, press<br>
        into her — as the field shreds itself
    </p>
    
    <p>
        with cricket cries. Show me how ruin makes a home<br>
        out of hip bones. O mother,
    </p>

    <p>
        O minutehand, teach me<br>
        how to hold a man the way thirst
    </p>
    
    <p>
        holds water. Let every river envy<br>
        our mouths. Let every kiss hit the body
    </p>
    
    <p>
        like a season. Where apples thunder<br>
        the earth with red hooves. &amp; I am your son.
